> *Tiny, stateless microservice to notify that your Discord bot is going under maintenance, made in Go*

## Why?
Since many things can happen from your bot going offline, this is a tiny microservice
to say "Hi, <bot name> is undergoing maintenance, please wait!"

Since this is stateless, only when you invoke your bots prefix (which is configured using the `MIKU_PREFIX` environment variable),
it will check if it has been sent that message once and sends it to that specific channel and will not say it again

It will also add a "Do Not Disturb" presence with saying "Going under maintenance!"
